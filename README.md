# World Fair Trade Organization Asia Data Tools

## Introduction

During my internship at the World Fair Trade Oraganization in Chiang Mai, Thailand I had the opportunity to work on communications tools and determine ways to better visualize data. I utilized R and Shiny software to create data visualization tools for staff who wanted to better understand the demographic information of organizational memebers.

I hope to produce more data visualizations that are more focused on social media presence and egagement to understand how WFTO Asia can improve their social media advocacy strategies and further increase website visits. 

The two visualizations produced can be found [here](https://6milesnlife.shinyapps.io/barsdiffcolor/) and [here](https://6milesnlife.shinyapps.io/countryappR/).
